# Newsletter-Signup
## If you are someone who wants to set up their own Newsletter where you want to email people who are interested in hearing from you, then you need a Sign-Up page, right? <br/>
That is exactly what this app is. On the front-end, it is a beautiful sign-up page and on the back-end, it has a functionality which allows you to sign people up to your mailing list.<br/>
MailChimp API has been used here to subscribe the members to our newsletter. It keeps track of all the people who have signed up/subscribed to our mailing list. So when you log into your MailChimp account and go to "Audience", you'll be able to see your list of subscribers!
